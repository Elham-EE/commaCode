# List to String Formatter
A simple Python function that takes a list and returns a formatted string based on the number of items in the list.

# About the Project
This project was developed as a simple, practical exercise to handle different string formatting scenarios in Python. The format_list_to_string function provides a reusable way to convert a list into a human-readable string, a common task in various applications.

The function handles four distinct cases:
1. Empty List: Returns a specific message indicating there are no items.
2. One Item: Appends the word "only" to the single item.
3.Two Items: Joins the two items with the word "and".
4. More than Two Items: Separates all items with a comma and adds "and" before the final item.
